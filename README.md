**Description**

  - This sample elasticdev file performs CI with docker exclusively on AWS/Ec2.  It will automatically create the ecr_repo for your docker images. If the ecr_repo exists, you can remove that section in the yml.  However, you can leave it and it will not do anything if the repo already exists.
