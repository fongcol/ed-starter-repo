**Description**

  - This sample elastic.yml creates a VPC and places an RDS in that VPC.  It highlights the power of composable of stacks in a yml, though stacks ingesting stacks fully exploits the power of the platform.  The yml provides a level of composability, but the full power is available in native python language.

  - The database credentials are randomly created.  The endpoint and credentials are shown in the output section of the project.
